					<h1>Abstract</h1>
					As cloud computing becomes more and more popular, ensuring its security becomes increasingly essential.  
					Homomorphic encryption provides an efficient, secure way to perform operations on data without the need to 
					decrypt and jeopardize its integrity.  This paper is a compilation of my own work involving the development 
					of a web-based user interface that portrays how different data types can be encrypted, have homomorphic operations 
					done on shares created from the data, then be decrypted.  For the creation of shares, Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing Scheme 
					was utilized because of its homomorphic properties.  In this paper, the programs written to encrypt each data type 
					are summarized.  Java was the chosen language to implement the programs due to its ability to easily create graphical 
					interfaces for practical usability.  Furthermore, each program along with its necessary directories (if any) are packed 
					into Java Archive files and/or ZIP files for quicker download times.
